## Portfolio Sample List

* **Online Help Systems** - An online help system is more than just pages of text. Its a form of user assistance, designed to walk a user directly to the topic that will best help them. Great online help systems know their audience, simplify the navigation, and stay on top of the most recent technological and design trends. Here are a few online help systems that I've pioneered in my career:

    * [Online Help System (Sphinx)](sphinx/overview.md) - An online help system using Sphinx and and Read the Docs to generate a clean, usable online help system with a very cost effective tool. 
    * [Online Help System (MadCap Flare)](flare/overview.md) - An online help system using MadCap Flare to create a single-source documentation platofrm that produces CHM, HTML and PDF deliverables. In addition, this system uses MadCap's localization tools to translate the documentation seamlessly into 5 different languages.
* **Knowledge Bases** - A knowledge base serves a centralized repository to store and share written information, such as manuals, procedures, frequently asked questions, troubleshooting information and more. When used as a documentation tool, a knowledge base can provide a friendly, informal platform to answer questions and get to know more about a product or company. I had the pleasure of setting up a knowledge base for a private beta application:

    * [Online Knowledge Base (HubSpot)](kb/overview.md) - Illustrates a knowledge base for frequently asked questions and troubleshooting information on a beta product.
* Technical White Paper - 
* API Reference Guide - Illustrates automatically generated API documentation using JSDoc. I implemented the entire system, from choosing and installing the tool(s) to writing the page templates, customizing the CSS, and hosting the documentation. The initial documentation was written by developers, and revised by my team of technical writers.
