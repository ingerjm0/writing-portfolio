## Adjusting to Remote Work
{: style="text-align:center;"}

The way we work is changing. As more companies go remote and create distributed environments, many workers are likely to try working from home for the first time. And for many, this idea of working remotely is foreign -- how do you maintain the same level of collaboration with your teammates? As a manager or executive, how do you ensure that morale stays high and your team stays connected with one another?

In this world, a new way of working may be a little daunting -- you need to get your computer set up, learn new processes to get your work done, and adjust to a new way of working with your colleagues. Here are a few tips I’ve gathered over my own distributed work experience that will hopefully help you and others adapt quickly and thrive in a new work environment.

1. **Come in with an open mind…it can make all the difference.** It will help you see the exciting possibilities, quickly adapt to your new workplace, and stay calm/troubleshoot if things go awry.
2. **Have all of your hardware ready and easily accessible.** This includes not only your computer, but also your headset, keyboard, mouse, and any other peripherals that will make you comfortable working all day at your computer. Also consider setting up your physical workspace ahead of time - the more comfortable you are in your physical location, the more comfortable you will be in the "remote workplace".
3. **Walk through your remote software tools.** You are likely going to need to learn to use new collaboration tools to work with your team from a distance. Start slow and read up on any getting started guides the provider may come with. Log in to these tools *before* you have any meetings scheduled and familiarize yourself with the camera, audio, and availability settings. You’ll be much more comfortable in your meeting if you know where all of the settings are ahead of time! 
4. **Set up your audio devices.** Most of the time, your audio will work "out of the box" with whatever remote software tool you choose to use. However, if you cannot hear anything (or others can’t hear you), then you will need to change your audio devices and/or configure your settings. *Pro tip: Choosing a high quality headset will greatly improve your remote work experience. I strongly recommend NOT using your computer’s microphone/speakers, as these devices will likely pick up background noise around you.*
5. **Test your microphone and headphones/speakers before your meetings.** Most remote software tools will let you check your audio input (microphone) and/or output (headphones/speaker) before entering a meeting. If either one isn’t working, then you have time to troubleshoot it beforehand without using valuable time in your meeting.
6. **Stick with it!** You know the saying "Practice makes perfect" Keep at it! Eventually working from home becomes easier, and you will be able to maintain your social and professional interactions with your colleagues. Who knows? Maybe you'll even begin to enjoy it!

Stay tuned! I’m working on another post about audio etiquette, and how to avoid those "awkward" moments of "I can’t hear you!" when working from home.
