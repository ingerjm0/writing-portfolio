# Reorganization of Help System

## Objective

To organize and structure our online help system in an effective and sustainable way

## Concepts 

1. **Every page is page one:** You cannot assume that everyone is coming in to the docs from the same place (i.e. your home page). The first page they see might be some random page linked to from the forums or something obscure that showed up in Google. So, structure and navigation is key! It must be good enough that our user can go from any page to the page that's relevant to them.
2. **People don't read:** Assume no one reads the docs (or even a page of the docs) from beginning to end. Therefore, use formatting to make it easy to find information – headings, hyperlinks, and lists make it easier to find content without reading the page.
3. **Clean, consistent and concise:** Looks nice, reads like one person wrote it, and gives just the right amount of information for our audience – not too much, not too little.

## Requirements 

The new structure must follow these rules to ensure that it abides by the "Concepts" described above: 

* The Table of Contents is always visible, and the user can click/open books without it moving around
* The TOC is never more than 4 books deep
* All pages should have content - no empty pages
* The help system must have a working search that finds stuff
* Group like-minded audience topics together - this means that like-minded topics may be scattered (for example, we'll talk about avatars under Explore and Create and Sell. That's what links and "See Also" sections are for)
* Its ok for pages to have a lot of content...we will add ways to navigate within a page
* Each page with multiple headings will have its own TOC at the top of the page. 

## Implementation 

<table>
  <thead><tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Assignee</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Draft New TOC</td>
      <td>Mock out new Table of Contents structure according to the requirements laid out; gain sign off from stakeholders</td>
      <td>Docs Manager (Kerry)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Implement TOC</td>
      <td>Create project with placeholders for the content pages. New project will reflect approved TOC.</td>
      <td>Docs Manager (Kerry)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Audit existing content</td>
      <td>Audit existing help system's content: identify obsolete content; propose where relevant content fits in new structure and any revisions that need to be made; identify missing content that needs to be written.</td>
      <td>Tech Writer (Karen)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>New Content</td>
      <td>Write new pages for missing content; add to new project.</td>
      <td>Tech Writer (Olan)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Existing Content</td>
      <td>Edit existing relevant content and add to new project.</td>
      <td>Tech Writer (Karen)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>Editorial Review</td>
      <td>Each technical writer/team member locally compiles and reviews the new project for errors. Keep an eye out for compilation errors, broken links, grammatical errors, formatting issues, etc.</td>
      <td>Kerry, Karen, Olan</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>Sign off</td>
      <td>Present staged deliverable for sign off.</td>
      <td>Docs Manager (Kerry)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>Deploy</td>
      <td>Work with Marketing on release schedule. Minor release = no email announcement, simply a forum post. Deploy via GitHub commit. </td>
      <td>Docs Manager (Kerry)</td>
    </tr> 
  </tbody>
</table>

* **CREATE** - For those who want create items
* **SCRIPT** - For those users who want to be delve deeper (with scripting) as an "advanced" user
* **HOST** - For those who want to build experiences for others and want to operate a domain as admin
* **SELL** - For those who want to sell their creations on the Marketplace
* **CONTRIBUTE** - For those who want to connect with us or contribute to the development of our product
