## Portfolio Sample List

* **Online Help Systems** - An online help system is more than just pages of text. Its a form of user assistance, designed to walk a user directly to the topic that will best help them. Great online help systems know their audience, simplify the navigation, and stay on top of the most recent technological and design trends. Here are a few online help systems that I've pioneered in my career:

    * [Online Help System (Sphinx)](sphinx/overview.md) - An online help system using Sphinx and and Read the Docs to generate a clean, usable online help system with a very cost effective tool. 
    * [Online Help System (MadCap Flare)](flare/overview.md) - An online help system using MadCap Flare to create a single-source documentation platofrm that produces CHM, HTML and PDF deliverables. In addition, this system uses MadCap's localization tools to translate the documentation seamlessly into 5 different languages.
* **Knowledge Bases** - A knowledge base serves a centralized repository to store and share written information, such as manuals, procedures, frequently asked questions, troubleshooting information and more. When used as a documentation tool, a knowledge base can provide a friendly, informal platform to answer questions and get to know more about a product or company. I had the pleasure of setting up a knowledge base for a private beta application:

    * [Online Knowledge Base (HubSpot)](kb/overview.md) - A knowledge base containing product information, getting started steps, frequently asked questions and troubleshooting information on a beta application.
* **Developer Documentation** - Developer documentation meets the developer where they are, providing language-specific guidance, API references, and code samples to illustrate an API usage. Whether its developing a developer's quick start guide, a detailed API reference, example code snippets, or walk-through tutorials, I've enjoyed working with programmers in many different languages.

    * [API Reference Guide (JavaScript)](js/overview.md) - An API reference guide generated from developer's comments using [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app). I customized the page templates and stylesheets, wrote an API overview and hosted the documentation using GitHub Pages. I oversaw the revision of all developer comments, identifying erroneous documentation, adding missing information, and creating example code snippets.
    * [JavaScript Quick Start](js-tips/overview.md) - A quickstart guide to help new users get acquainted with using JavaScript for the first time. 
    * [Getting Started Guide (XML)](xml/overview.md) - A Getting Started manual on how to use a proprietary XML schema.
    * [Developer Tutorials (JavaScript/C#/VB.NET)](tutorial/overview.md) - Examples of tutorials written to demonstrate how developers can use various APIs and implement advanced functionality in their custom apps. 

* **Technical White Papers** - A technical white paper informs the reader about a specific, complex topic. Its purpose is to help the reader understand a complicated topic, resolve an issue, or make an informed decision.

   * [Technical White Paper (MadCap Flare)](whitepaper/overview.md) - A technical white paper placeholder
