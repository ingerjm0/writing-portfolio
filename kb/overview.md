## Online Knowledge Base

**Tools Used:** HubSpot, Paint.NET, Markdown, HTML

This project involved creating an online searchable knowledge base for a new, early-access beta software application. I identified the top user stories and developed categories to match what users would want to know. I then conceptualized and wrote all of the content for the knowledge base. Working closely with the Marketing team, I then developed a design that was clean and consistent with the company's branding strategy.

All images were edited using the open source software, Paint.NET. Pages were written and formatted in Markdown, with minor edits made using HTML.
