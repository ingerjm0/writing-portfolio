# Knowledge Bases

A knowledge base serves a centralized repository to store and share written information, such as manuals, procedures, frequently asked questions, troubleshooting information and more. When used as a documentation tool, a knowledge base can provide a friendly, informal platform to answer questions and get to know more about a product or company.

<p>This project involved creating an online searchable knowledge base for a new, early-access beta software application. To complete this task, I successfully:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identified the top user stories and developed categories to match our customer's needs</li>
  <li>Conceptualized and wrote all of the content for the knowledge base</li>
  <li>Developed a design that was clean and consistent with the company's branding strategy. </li>
</ul>
