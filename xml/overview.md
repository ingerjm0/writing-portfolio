**Tools Used:** MadCap Flare, Perforce, XML, HTML, CSS

This quick start guides walks IT professionals through integrating BarTender software ([https://www.seagullscientific.com](seagullscientific.com)) with other applications with BarTender XML Script. Specifically, the BTXML schema provides a way to pass print job data from an external interface directly to BarTender. An XML response message, which contains data that can be used to verify the completion of the job, is automatically created each time a script is received.

Throughout the years, this content has been adopted into many deliverable formats: an introduction to an online help system, a technical white paper, and a BTXML reference guide.
