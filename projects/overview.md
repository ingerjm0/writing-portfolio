# Project Planning

Every project plan tells a story about the project's background, goals, teams, and deliverables. Just like a creative narrative, a project plan fills in details and a timeline in chapters (or phases) and ensures a "happily ever after" for the stakeholders. It serves as a roadmap that shows a project's phases, key activities, dependencies between tasks, and project milestones.
