## Limitations

Limitations of using website's toolset for knowledge base: 

* Lack of customization options (fonts, intro text, etc)
* Articles have limited formatting (i.e. no tables)

## Maintenance

* Articles will be added to the knowledge base over time. All new articles should be tracked in the Jira DOC project.
* Docs and CS will have access to change/update articles
